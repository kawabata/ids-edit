* IDS Editing Tool for Emacs

** Overview

This file provides IDS (Ideographic Description Sequence)
composition/decomposition tools for Emacs. The IDS represents a
structure of Ideographs.  For example, "地" can be decomposed to
"⿰土也" in IDS, and "⿱艹化" can be composed to "花". "⿰" and "⿱"
are called IDCs (Ideographic Description Characters).

** Demonstration

** Description

Today, more than 81,000 ideographs have been encoded in Unicode. To
ease typing appropriate ideograph among them, selecting appropriate
character by a component and stroke number is one of the solution.

Once you install this tool, "ids-edit-mode" and "global-ids-edit-mode"
will be enabled. In this mode, you can decompose ideograph, compose
ideograph by component and stroke number, and type in IDC by simple
key combination.

** Usage

*** ids-edit-mode

Minor `ids-edit-mode' and 'global-ids-edit-mode' will let you input
IDCs and compose/decompose ideographs by M-U key.

| key | command       |
|-----+---------------|
| M-0 | "⿰" (U+2FF0) |
| M-1 | "⿱" (U+2FF1) |
| M-2 | "⿲" (U+2FF2) |
| M-3 | "⿳" (U+2FF3) |
| M-4 | "⿴" (U+2FF4) |
| M-5 | "⿵" (U+2FF5) |
| M-6 | "⿶" (U+2FF6) |
| M-7 | "⿷" (U+2FF7) |
| M-8 | "⿸" (U+2FF8) |
| M-9 | "⿹" (U+2FF9) |
| M-- | "⿺" (U+2FFa) |
| M-= | "⿻" (U+2FFb) |
| M-U | ids-edit      |

*** Decomposing CJK Ideographs to IDS

Just type `M-U' (meta-shift-u) after the position of target CJK
Ideograph. There should be no numerics, ideographs or IDCs at the
cursor.  With prefix argument given, it tries to decomposes previous
character unconditionally.

*** Composing IDS to CJK Ideograph

Type `M-U' on partial IDS. It may contain a (range of) strokes
number. When there are multiple candidates, they will all be
inserted to the current position with bracket. Attaching G,T,J,K at
the end will limit the candidates to specific charset (namely,
GB2312, Big5, JISX0213/0212, KSX1001).

For example, "⿰氵20-22J", with cursor on "⿰" character, will be
composed to "[灊灝灞灣]".

** Install

You can directly install this tool with
[[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]].

If you install manually, please BYTE-COMPILE the elisp file. That will
integrate data files into compiled lisp file. Following setting would
suffice.

: (require 'ids-edit)
: (global-ids-edit-mode)
